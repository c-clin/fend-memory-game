# Memory Game Project

### This is the last front-end project for the Udacity Intro to Programming class.

## Getting Started

### Installing

To get started, download the code and decompress the zip file. Then open the the `index.html` file to start playing the game.

### Play the Game

There are two sets of 8 different cards in the deck and the player must match all of the identical cards in order to win. Simply click on  the cards to flip them over and the cards will flip back automatically if they do not match. The player must rely on their memory to remember the placement of the identical cards.

### Special Features

The game counts each moves played by the player and the stars on the score panel will decrease accordingly until there is only one star left. A timer is also in place to record the time it takes for the player to finish the game. The restart button can be clicked anytime during the game if player wants to start over. 

### Dependencies

The game was built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
